*Reach the surface before the sea snakes get you!*

This project serves as a test project for the [Rust-Graphics](https://github.com/bvssvni/rust-graphics) API and [Piston](https://github.com/bvssvni/piston) game engine. The main goal is to improve Rust-Graphics. Do not expect it to have high quality as a game.
